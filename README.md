# fast_elnatstaxa_sensor
A n00bs way of adding elnätstaxa to Home Assistant


Nothing much here really, but I got tired of the integrations of Nordpool and Tibber, and that none of them include the tax and energy transmission costs.

so I made some sensors that probably will help out in some way.
Use as you wish, Im just a n00b so dont expect any magic from me in this repository. ;)

There are two files
One of them spilt all costs of an Ellevio 20A subscribtion into the real costs kr/h and kr/kWh.
Hopefully someone will make a proper custom component that can calculate any of the Swedish nätbolag but well.
